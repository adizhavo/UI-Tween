# UI-Tween
Refactored and enhanced version of UI Tween library in Unity3D

The old library [here](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/38583) is too coupled to the editor, efficient for fast projects, but becomes very complex in the long run. Most of the old solution are decouple from the editor in this new version.
